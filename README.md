## About

This repository contains a collection of five workshops designed to introduce high school students to essential concepts in AI and Python programming. These activities were created to support the development of their year-long school project: a mobile application using Python and AI.

The workshops cover topics such as decision-making algorithms, AI classification models, and user interface design, providing students with the knowledge and skills needed to complete their project. Key features include practical exercises, hands-on coding, and real-world applications to solidify understanding and encourage creativity.

This project was undertaken during my first year of engineering studies (Bac+3) as part of an internship with the company [Youth Fusion](https://fusionjeunesse.org/en/home/), offering valuable experience in applying technical knowledge to educational development and fostering collaboration with high school students.
